When it comes to the perfect apple pie there are 2 questions you need to ask. What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust.
Best apples for pie
There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store!
Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush.
Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process.
Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety.
Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others.
Jonagold - A little tart and sweet.
Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet.
The perfect pie crust
Easy apple pie
A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either an all-butter pie crust or an sourdough pie crust. Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat!
